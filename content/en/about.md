Hi there! I'm Caio.
I make apps and games (see my [work](/work)).

I made this website to write about my projects and other several things that I'm interested in. You can find the source code for this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/KyleKun/blog). There's no analytics, no ads, no tracking - feel free to browse it all you want without worrying about your privacy.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š

# Interests

My main interests currently are in the areas of <u>technology</u>, <u>music</u> and <u>philosophy</u>. 

Apart from my personal projects, you can (but shouldn't ðŸ˜‰) expect blog posts about these topics:

#### Tech
- Flutter
- VR/AR
- Game development
- AI

#### Music
- Piano playing
- Classical music
- Composing

#### Philosophy
- More topics than I should list on here, so you will have to wait and see ðŸ˜…



# Goals with this blog

1. Write about my projects and other things that I'm interested in.
2. Share things that might be helpful or interesting to someone.
2. Improve my writing skills.

I hope you enjoy it! <a target="_blank" href="https://kylekun.ck.page/profile">
